<h3>Risk</h3>

<h3>Vulnerable Code</h3>

<pre>
var cookie = new HttpCookie("test");
</pre>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<b>Web.Config</b>
<pre>
&lt;httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="true" [..] /&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
var cookie = new HttpCookie("test");
cookie.Secure = true;
cookie.HttpOnly = true; //Add this flag
</pre>
